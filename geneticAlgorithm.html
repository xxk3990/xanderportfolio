                This is a project I made in April 2018 in which I wrote code that applied different processes in
                Genetics to a set of 9 hue grids. I did
                mutation, crossover, selection, and breeding (either the first grid or 9 new ones). The hue grids
                themselves have different designs that I chose to implement.
                I have a range of red, a range of blue, a range of green, and a rainbow color. Each color has a random
                layout, a vertical stripe layout, a horizontal stripe layout,
                and a gradient.
                The muation takes the first grid and mutates it, the crossover takes the first grid and crosses it with
                another random grid, the select1 takes the first grid and does selection on it, the breed1 breeds a new
                grid in the first spot,
                and the breed gen breeds a whole new generation of huegrids that are "children" of the 1st grid,
                inheriting "chromosomes" from it. You can also adjust the rate at which
                each square in the hue grid changes and the transparency. This was all done using a JavaScript library
                called P5.
