                            product are random as this data is not from the prod version. The middle image is the same
                            set of data as it appears in Postico. To avoid storing duplicate data in the DB, the product
                            info – such as the name and image – are not stored in Order_Items but rather are grabbed
                            from the Products table (using the product_uuid) and added to the data when its sent to the
                            frontend. The product's original price is multiplied by the quantity of the order item to
                            get the item price. The right image is the endpoint with the full cart JSON. <br>

                        <li>I started working on this in August of this year. I began by doing research on fitness sites
                            to see what others were doing. I then took what I found in my research and what my trainer
                            told me he wanted and put them into a requirements document. Once he and I determined it was
                            the highest priority, I began working on the shopping cart.</li>

            <h3>Challenges I Face:</h3>
            <ul class="challenges-list work-list">
                <li> One of the challenges I faced early on was deciding how I was going to store and work with prices.
                <li>After looking at a few online examples of the best conventions for how people store prices, I
                    decided to go with them as integers throughout the site and then divide them by 100 only when
                    displaying to the user.</li>
                </li>
                <li>This is one of the first experiences I've had where I set all the coding conventions myself, so I
                    have to make sure I'm always doing it in the cleanest and easiest possible way.
                    <ul class="sub-bullets">
                        <li>At the beginning of the shopping cart implementation process, I was doing everything wrong
                            but didn't know it. I was doing the adding/subtracting of the price calculations manually
                            (rather than just multiplying the quantity by the unit price each time), storing prices in
                            the database, and was doing some of the math on the front end, which it turned out was not
                            the cleanest way to do it. At the beginning, my code looked incredibly complex like an
                            anger-inducing error waiting to happen.
                            After a few days of research on conventions, I found a cleaner way – moving all calculations
                            to the backend, taking all prices (except for product price and order total) out of the db,
                            and making the item_price and order_total only calculate at runtime, ensuring changes to the
                            cart automatically update the order total. If I kept the item_price on the order_items
                            model, I would need to manually update it each time. In the new way, all I have to do is
                            have the quantity go up or down by 1 and the price will be adjusted automatically when its
                            sent to the frontend.
