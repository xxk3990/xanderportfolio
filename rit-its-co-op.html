            <ul class="team-list work-list">
                <li>The team was me and four other co-op students. I was the web designer. There were three Web
                    Developers and one Business Analyst.
                </li>
                <li>Our team also had a group of very helpful and kind advisors that we had weekly update presentation
                    meetings with.</li>

            <h3>Challenges I Faced:</h3>
            <ul class="challenges-list work-list">
                <li> I went into this co-op with very little experience in the industry. It was my first official programming
                    job (I had done some internships before but this was the first job).
                    Had to learn how to work in sprints, use work boards (like Jira and Trello) build and deploy the app
                    (.war file) to various environments (local, development, test, production) from scratch.
                    <ul class="sub-bullets">
                        <li>For the first few weeks it seemed very daunting and scary. I was at first worried that I
                            wouldn't have time to learn it, as there was a lot to learn and understand how to do.
                            Thankfully, the advisors were more than happy to make sure everyone understood, and so, through practice and help from them and my teammates, I was able to get the hang of it!</li>
                </li>
                <li>This was also the first experience I'd had making changes based on user feedback. Many of the
                    changes we implelemted were based on input from users of the app.
                    <ul class="sub-bullets">
                        <li>Before this, I'd make design and layout changes based on what I thought, and so I had to
                            change my design strategies and make sure I was making changes that would work best for the users.
                    </ul>
                <li>If I could do it over again, I'd make sure I was as open to as many new ideas and feedback as
                    possible, as I am very grateful to this company for all they taught me and helped me learn!</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Exceeding Expectations:</h3>
            One instance I think could qualify as going beyond their expectations was my CSS work. I helped the
            developers style their features, fixed some design issues in the app, and made some of the pages more mobile
            friendly.
            At one point in the co-op the developers' advisor (each role had a separate advisor), said to me that I'd
            made more CSS changes than some of the previous web designers, as many of them kept more of a graphic design
            role.
