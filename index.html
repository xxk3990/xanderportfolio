                    My name is Xander Kaylan, and I've been writing code since 2016. I'm a recent graduate of Rochester Institute of Technology. I graduated cum laude with a Bachelor of Science in New Media Interactive Development. My final cumulative GPA was 3.59.
                    Before RIT, I worked with JavaScript combined with HTML.
                    I used this to make the Party List Using Google Firebase project. At RIT, my first year began with doing JavaScript
                    on its own (utilizing a library called p5.js) while also separately learning HTML with CSS.
                    Using only JavaScript I made the Genetic Algorithm of Hue Grids project. My second year brought my learning of JavaScript back to a web based setting – I learned to work with the DOM, learned event handlers/listeners, and learned to make XMLHttpRequests to APIs (and displaying the response data).
                    My knowledge of JS then became more advanced in my third year – I learned about HTML5 Canvas and the Web Audio API, which I combined to make the Audio Visualizer project. In my fourth year I started learning Node.js and MongoDB, giving me some experience with back-end development such as handling GET and POST requests, login systems, and working with databases! 
                    Since July 2022 (after I graduated), I've been working together with a friend to improve our React.js skills.

                    I also completed two semester-long paid co-ops before graduating (RIT ITS in fall 2019 and Paychex Inc. in summer 2021) in which I was introduced to new programming frameworks/languages (both front-end and back-end), software, and industry-common aspects of a team development project such as the Agile Methodology (daily stand-ups, peer code reviews, sprint planning, sprint boards, sprint retrospectives) 
                    uploading code through various environments from local &#8594; production, unit, user, and regression testing, documentation, and working with different git branches and doing pull/merge requests.
                    
                    I hope to utilize everything I've learned working as an interactive developer! This entire portfolio was coded by me and is also 100% mobile friendly!
