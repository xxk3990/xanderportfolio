                    My name is Xander Kaylan, and I'm a full-stack developer with three years experience. I graduated from Rochester
                    Institute of Technology in 2022. I graduated cum laude with a Bachelor of Science
                    in New Media Interactive Development. My final cumulative GPA was 3.59.
                    While at RIT, I honed my JavaScript and HTML/CSS skills, working on everything from p5.js to HTML5 canvas to React.js to Node.js.
                    Since graduation, I have continued teaching myself more Node.js and React, and have since incorporated PostgreSQL and Sequelize into my wheelhouse as well.

                    <br>
                    I hope to utilize everything I've learned working as an interactive developer! This entire portfolio
                    was coded by me and is also 100% mobile friendly!
