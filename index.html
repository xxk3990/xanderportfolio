                    My name is Xander Kaylan, and I've been writing code since 2016. I'm a recent graduate of Rochester
                    Institute of Technology (August 2017 – May 2022). I graduated cum laude with a Bachelor of Science
                    in New Media Interactive Development. My final cumulative GPA was 3.59.
                    Before RIT, I worked with JavaScript combined with HTML.
                    I used this to make the Party List Using Google Firebase project. At RIT, my first year began with
                    doing JavaScript on its own (utilizing a library called p5.js) while also separately learning HTML
                    with CSS.
                    Using only JavaScript I made the Genetic Algorithm of Hue Grids project. My second year brought my
                    learning of JavaScript back to a web based setting – I learned to work with the DOM, learned event
                    handlers/listeners, and learned to make XMLHttpRequests to APIs (and displaying the response JSON
                    data).
                    My knowledge of JS then became more advanced in my third year – I learned about HTML5 Canvas
                    and the Web Audio API, which I combined to make the Audio Visualizer project. In my fourth year I
                    started learning Node.js and MongoDB, giving me experience with server side development such as
                    handling GETand POST requests, login systems, and working with databases.
                    I also learned React.js that year (Handlebars was used for the templating) and created apps with a
                    Node.js back-end and a React.js front-end. Since July 2022 (after I graduated), a friend and I have
                    been working together to create a React.js web app that displays data about meteors that have fallen over the years.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I have also completed two semester-long paid internships before graduating (RIT Information and Technology Services in fall 2019 and
                    Paychex Inc. in summer 2021) in which I was introduced to new programming frameworks/languages (both
                    front-end and back-end), software, and industry-common aspects of a team development project such as
                    the Agile Methodology (daily stand-ups, peer code reviews, sprint planning, sprint boards, sprint
                    retrospectives) uploading code through various environments from local &#8594; production, unit,
                    user, and regression testing, documentation, and working with different git branches
                    and pull/merge requests.

                    I hope to utilize everything I've learned working as an interactive developer! This entire portfolio
                    was coded by me and is also 100% mobile friendly!
