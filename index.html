                    My name is Xander Kaylan, and I've been writing code since 2016. I'm a recent graduate of Rochester
                    Institute of Technology (August 2017 – May 2022). I graduated cum laude with a Bachelor of Science
                    in New Media Interactive Development. My final cumulative GPA was 3.59.
                    While at RIT, I honed my JavaScript and HTML/CSS skills, working on everything from p5.js to HTML5 canvas to React.js to Node.js.
                    Since graduation, I have continued teaching myself more Node.js and React, and have since incorporated PostgreSQL and Sequelize into my wheelhouse as well.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I also completed two semester-long paid internships before graduating (RIT Information and Technology Services in fall 2019 and
                    Paychex Inc. in summer 2021) in which I was introduced to new programming frameworks/languages (both
                    front-end and back-end), software, and industry-common aspects of a team development project such as
                    the Agile Methodology (daily stand-ups, peer code reviews, sprint planning, sprint boards, sprint
                    retrospectives) uploading code through various environments from local &#8594; production, unit,
                    user, and regression testing, documentation, and working with different git branches
                    and pull/merge requests. In 2023, after months of teaching myself more Node.js and React and learning to work with PostgreSQL and Sequelize, I am using what I have taught myself to build a full-stack web app for my personal trainer, allowing his clients to purchase exercise sessions, apparel, and eventually they will be able to create their own profile to track their workout goals.

                    I hope to utilize everything I've learned working as an interactive developer! This entire portfolio
                    was coded by me and is also 100% mobile friendly!
