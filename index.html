                    My name is Xander Kaylan, and I've been writing code since 2016. I'm a recent graduate of Rochester Institute of Technology. I graduated cum laude with a Bachelor of Science in New Media Interactive Development.
                    Before RIT, I worked with JavaScript combined with HTML.
                    I used this to make the Party List Using Google Firebase project. At RIT, I began doing JavaScript
                    on its own, continued learning HTML, and started CSS.
                    Using only JavaScript I made the Genetic Algorithm of Hue Grids project. I then moved into C#, and started with making console apps. I used this to make the 20 Questions game. At the same time,
                    I then resumed combining JS with HTML/CSS – I learned more about the DOM and using JS to manipulate HTML and adjust CSS. 
                    My knowledge of JS then became more advanced – I learned about HTML5 Canvas and the Web Audio API, which I combined to make the Audio Visualizer project. It's not shown in this portfolio, but after working with canvas, I started learning Node.js and MongoDB, giving me some experience with back-end development such as handling GET and POST requests, login systems, and working with databases!
                    I hope to utilize everything I've learned working as an interactive developer! This entire portfolio was coded by me and is also 100% mobile friendly!
