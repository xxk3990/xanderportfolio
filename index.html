                    My name is Xander Kaylan, and I've been writing code since 2016. I'm currently a 3rd year student pursuing a New Media Interactive Development degree at Rochester Institute of Technology.
                    Before RIT, I worked with JavaScript combined with HTML.
                    I used this to make the Party List Using Google Firebase project. At RIT, I began doing JavaScript
                    on its own, continued learning HTML, and started CSS.
                    Using only JavaScript I made the Genetic Algorithm of Hue Grids project. <br> I then moved into C#, and started with making console apps. I used this to make the 20 Questions game. At the same time,
                    I then resumed combining JS with HTML/CSS – I learned more about the DOM and using JS to manipulate HTML and adjust CSS. 
                    My knowledge of JS then became more advanced – I learned about HTML5 Canvas and the Web Audio API, which I combined to make the Audio Visualizer project.
                    I hope to utilize everything I've learned working as an interactive developer!
