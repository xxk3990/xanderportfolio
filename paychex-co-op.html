            <h3>Challenges I Faced:</h3>
            <ul class="challenges-list work-list">
                <li> I went into this internship solely as a front-end developer, as the only
                    server side experience I had leading up to that point was Node.js and Java.
                    <ul class="sub-bullets">
                        <li>For the first few weeks I was mainly in a front-end role.
                            However, a few weeks in, I was working on an Angular form that would add new fields to
                            certain policies in the database. The back-end developers on our team had full task-loads,
                            so, in order to implement the feature, I had to quickly learn Python and Python Flask. </li>
                        <li>
                            It seemed very intimidating at first. I often use my knowledge of other coding languages as
                            a starting point when learning new ones (and in the past my knowledge of C# helped me with
                            writing Java), but Python has unique coding, formatting, and syntax requirements and doesn't
                            allow a lot of what is required or permitted in the langauges I had learned in my major,
                            JavaScript and C#, so I was unable to use a large portion of my prior coding, syntax, and
                            formatting knowledge as a base. Facing these challenges head on made me really enjoy trying
                            a new language and I found that I was ready for even more new challenges. I decided to start
                            by studying the code my teammates wrote for the other database calls and used that to get a
                            hang of things.
                        </li>
                        <ul class="sub-sub-bullets">
                            <li>This worked perfectly – eventually by the end I was writing more advanced Flask
                                api-handling code to not just pull data from a database container but also to upsert
                                it (a cool databasing term I learned on this job that means update if something exists
                                or insert if it doesn’t!) and, in one case, create the container via Flask, upsert data
                                into it, and, for each new POST request, check if the container existed and if it did
                                add to the existing one instead of creating a new duplicate one.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                </li>
                <li>If I could do it over again, I’d make sure to not be as hesitant about writing back-end code
                    – I thoroughly enjoyed working with Python Flask and am very grateful (one of a VERY LONG
                    list of things I'm grateful to <em> Paychex</em> for!) to this company for helping me leave
                    my comfort zone to try new things. </li>

            <h3>Exceeding Expectations:</h3>
            One instance I think could qualify as going beyond their expectations was, continuing from the previous
            section, my switch from front-end to full stack developer. I was initially hired for my front-end & UI/UX
            skills – someone who could layout a web app, style it, populate the app with data, and create icons and
            logos whenever needed. After I went out of my comfort zone and began writing server side code as well, other
            developers congratulated and thanked me for adapting to and taking on a new role so quickly and for the
            benefit of both the app and its users.
