                <li>Created a portal allowing insurance teams to view policies that require attention.

                <li>Requirements for features on the app were provided by a Paychex employee who had just graduated from
                    University of Buffalo so he was close to our age and understood how young developers in the industry
                    think and handle situations. </li>

            <h3>Challenges I Faced:</h3>
            <ul class="challenges-list work-list">
                <li> I went into this co-op as a purely front-end developer with only some server side experience. The
                    server
                    side experience I had leading up to that point was only Node.js API handling and a little Java.
                    <ul class="sub-bullets">
                        <li>For the first few weeks I tried to stay in a front-end role but a time came when I had to
                            write some server side code in Python Flask (the back-end developers on our team were busy
                            with other important tasks)</li>
                        <li>Server side code took API call from front-end and either updated, created, or pulled data
                            from Cosmos DB.</li>
                        <li>It was very intimidating at first looking at a language I had never worked with before, so I
                            decided to begin by going off what my teammates had done and using that to get a better hang
                            of it.
                            <ul class="sub-sub-bullets">
                                <li>This worked perfectly – eventually by the end I was writing more advanced Flask
                                    api-handling code to not just pull data from a database container but also to upsert
                                    it (a fancy databasing word for update if something exists or insert if it doesn’t!)
                                    and,
                                    in one case, create the container via Flask, upsert data into it, and, for each new
                                    POST request, check if the container existed and if it did add to the existing one
                                    instead of creating a new duplicate one.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>If I could do it over again, I’d make sure to not be as hesitant about writing back-end code
                            – I thoroughly enjoyed working with Python Flask and am very grateful (one of a VERY LONG
                            list of things I'm grateful to <em> Paychex</em> for!) to this company for helping me leave
                            my areas of expertise to try new things. </li>

            <h3>Exceeding Expectations:</h3>
            One instance I think could qualify as going beyond their expectations was, continuing from the previous
            section, my switch from front-end to full stack developer. I was initially hired for my front-end & UI/UX
            skills – someone who could layout a web app, style it, populate the app with data, and create icons and
            logos whenever needed. After I went out of my comfort zone and began writing server side code as well, other
            developers congratulated and thanked me for adapting to and taking on a new role so quickly and for the
            benefit of both the app and its users.
