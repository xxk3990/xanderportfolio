                In March 2020, I combined HTML5 Canvas and the Web Audio API to show canvas elements changing based on audio. I implemented a Bezier Curve, 2 triangles, a row of bars, and image effects such as invert, emboss, and noise.
                I coded play/pause and track timing by hand, added a progress slider that updates as the track plays, text that shows current minute and second, and made dragging the slider change the track progress.
                I then added an option to activate a distortion effect on the audio and canvas and adjust the value using a range input. The user can freely click to show or hide all display options, adjust all sliders, and change both the curve and triangle colors at any point while the app is running. 
                Finally, I added a file upload option so users can upload their own files. The file is saved, so the user could switch between the dropdown list of pre-loaded tracks and their uploaded file. The project is also written utilizing ES6 Modules format.

                Implemented new features in September 2021 – added functionality to allow users to choose between three color options for the Bezier curve – gradient, single color, and the previous changing color based on audio, changing the background color to a new random gradient or single color, and moved the controls to the side for more space. Also increased the canvas size!
