        The process of making this portfolio was a long and stressful one but ultimately was very much worth it and I'm so glad I now have it done. A lot of this project involved me implementing things I was familiar with doing and came easily to me.
        There were a few challenges I faced as well. For example, I struggled a bit with CSS Grid for getting my pages laid out correctly, but after getting some help and 
        a bit of trial and error I was able to get it to work on my own. There are many things I'm proud of in this portfolio. I was very happy to see my CSS animations work -- The images on the project page expand when you hover over them!
        One page I'm particularly proud of is the "Problems with Autonomous Cars" project page. I like this one because I struggled with getting all four images to display evenly
        accross the page and then also work in the mobile version. After replacing my CSS Flexbox format with a Grid format, it finally worked! <br> My thought process for this site was simple. I needed an easily readable design with colors that didn't contrast too much. I went with white text on a dark blue background, which is a design I've found works well in the past. I also wanted a portfolio that could be viewed
by co-op employers, full time employers (after RIT), and freelance employers. I included any projects I’ve done that may relate to what they are looking for, anything that shows what type of person I am, a way to view my résumé, and a page that includes my contact information. 
After some revisions to my CSS, the main project page, each individual project page and the home page now have a perfect CSS Grid layout. Each site now works on mobile as well!
